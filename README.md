## Database Normalization

When creating a database, it is really important to think about how data will be stored. This is known as **normalization**, and it is a huge part of most SQL classes. If you are in charge of setting up a new database, it is important to have a thorough understanding of database normalization.

There are essentially three ideas that are aimed at database normalization:

* Are the tables storing logical groupings of the data?
* Can I make changes in a single location, rather than in many tables for the same information?
* Can I access and manipulate data quickly and efficiently?

This is discussed in detail [here](https://www.itprotoday.com/sql-server/sql-design-why-you-need-database-normalization).

## Introduction to JOINs

```sql
-- Inner Join --
SELECT orders.*,
       accounts.*
FROM orders 
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
```

The **SELECT** clause indicates which column(s) of data you'd like to see in the output (For Example, `orders.*` gives us all the columns in the orders table in the output). The **FROM** clause indicates the first table from which we're pulling data, and the **JOIN** indicates the second table. The **ON** clause specifies the column on which you'd like to merge the two tables together. 

```sql
-- pull individual elements from either the orders or accounts table --
SELECT accounts.name, orders.occurred_at
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
```

The below query pulls all the columns from both the accounts and orders table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN accounts
ON orders.account_id = accounts.id;
```

## Entity Relationship Diagrams

An **entity-relationship diagram (ERD)** is a common way to view data in a database. It is also a key element to understanding how we can pull data from multiple tables.

It will be beneficial to have an idea of what the ERD looks like for Parch & Posey.

## Keys

### Primary Key (PK)

A **primary key** is a unique column in a particular table. This is the first column in each of our tables. Here, those columns are all called id, but that doesn't necessarily have to be the name. **It is common that the primary key is the first column in our tables in most databases**.

### Foreign Key (FK)

A **foreign key** is a column in one table that is a primary key in a different table. We can see in the Parch & Posey ERD that the foreign keys are:

1. region_id
2. account_id
3. sales_rep_id

Each of these is linked to the primary key of another table. An example is shown in the image below:

## Primary - Foreign Key Link

In the above image you can see that:

1. The **region_id** is the foreign key.
2. The region_id is **linked** to id - this is the primary-foreign key link that connects these two tables.
3. The crow's foot shows that the **FK** can actually appear in many rows in the **sales_reps** table.
4. While the single line is telling us that the **PK** shows that id appears only once per row in this table.
